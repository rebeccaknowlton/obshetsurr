4-21-25 NOTE: this repository was archived, because we incorporated the functions into the existing R package cohetsurr on CRAN. There is no longer a separate obshetsurr package, but these methods are still available in cohetsurr.

This repository contains a package, obshetsurr, which provides functions to assess heterogeneity in the strength of a surrogate marker with respect to multiple baseline covariates in an observational setting, using meta-learners. Available base learners include linear, GAM, and regression forests.
